## Assignment Description

This Assignment provided an HTML and CSS file that had to be refactored. What refactoring means is to clean up the HTML code written and make it more accessible.

In addition to refactoring I wrote comments throughout the code infront of various elements. I was changing al the divs to describe more of what they actually are and help with your CSS.


## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

## Hints

...
 The goal of refactoring is to clean up the code to make it easier to read. When you are refactoring you DO NOT want to change the code itself.
